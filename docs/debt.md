## How to Use This File

Each entry follows this format:

```
### [DEBT-NNN] Short title
- **Severity:** low | medium | high | critical
- **Area:** component / module / system affected
- **Logged:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Author:** name or handle
- **Description:** What is the problem and why does it exist?
- **Impact:** What breaks or degrades if this is not fixed?
- **Fix:** What would a correct resolution look like?
- **Unblocked by:** What needs to happen before this can be addressed? (optional)
```

Severity guide:
- **critical** — actively causing data loss, security issues, or production outages.
- **high** — causing user-facing bugs or significantly slowing development.
- **medium** — creates friction; should be fixed within the next 2–3 milestones.
- **low** — nice-to-have cleanup; address opportunistically.
